# AIMINIPROJECT1
The aim of this project is to automatically recognize handwritten digits (from 0 to 9) by training a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on the MNIST dataset, which is a standard benchmark in machine learning.

Problem Statement
Recognizing handwritten digits is a classic pattern recognition problem.
In real-world applications, this is used in systems like:

Postal address reading

Bank cheque verification

Form scanning and automation

Manually processing such data is slow and error-prone.
Hence, we automate digit recognition using Artificial Neural Networks

While more complex models like CNNs exist, here I intentionally chose a simple MLP model to:

Show that even basic neural networks can achieve good performance

Understand the fundamentals of how neural networks learn patterns

Keep the architecture lightweight, fast, and easy to implement

Results
Achieved around 97% accuracy on unseen test data.

Model can accurately predict most handwritten digits.

Fast training due to the small and simple architecture.

Final Takeaway

This project shows that even a basic neural network, when properly trained,
can solve real-world problems effectively and efficiently without needing complex designs.

It builds strong foundational understanding â€” which is critical before moving to more advanced AI techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers.
